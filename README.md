#About project
Image segmentation is like giving each object in a picture its own label or identity.
To make this happen, a computer algorithm analyzes the different parts of the image, looking for things like color, texture, or shape differences.
Just like how our brains recognize objects based on their distinct features, the algorithm identifies regions in the image that share similar characteristics.
This process is fundamental in tasks like object detection, medical imaging, autonomous driving, and more, where understanding the individual components of an image is crucial.

#Data
1.Custom dataset for object localization
2.Brain tumor object detection datasets

#Deployment
The project is deployed on Streamlit

#How to run locally?
To create a Python virtual environment for running the code, enter:
python3 -m venv my-env.

Activate the new environment:
Windows: my-env\Scripts\activate.bat
macOS and Linux: source my-env/bin/activate

Install all dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt
